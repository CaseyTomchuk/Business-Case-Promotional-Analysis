        "The Story:\n",
        "TechTime Gadgets is an innovative online retailer specializing in the latest electronic gadgets. In an effort to boost sales and refine its promotional strategies, the management has decided to analyze both current pricing structures and sales performance. They need a flexible, modular Python program that not only calculates discounted prices and aggregates sales data but also generates a timestamped report and computes the Return on Investment (ROI) from recent promotions.\n",

        "**Calculate Discounted Prices**:\n",
