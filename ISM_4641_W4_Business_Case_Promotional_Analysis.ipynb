        "# Business Case: TechTime Gadgets Promotional Analysis\n",
        "The Story:\n",
        "TechTime Gadgets is an innovative online retailer specializing in the latest electronic gadgets. In an effort to boost sales and refine its promotional strategies, the management has decided to analyze both current pricing structures and sales performance. They need a flexible, modular Python program that not only calculates discounted prices and aggregates sales data but also generates a timestamped report and computes the Return on Investment (ROI) from recent promotions.\n",

        "## What needs to be done\n",
        "\n",
        "**Calculate Discounted Prices**:\n",
        "Create a function that calculates the final price of a product after applying a discount percentage. This function should have default arguments where appropriate.\n",

        "**Aggregate Sales Data and Generate a Report**:\n",

        "**Sum the provided sales figures**.\n",
        "Incorporate the additional metrics into a formatted report.\n",
